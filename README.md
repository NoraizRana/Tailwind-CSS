# 🌟 Tailwind CSS Practice & Projects

Welcome to my Tailwind CSS practice and project collection! This repository contains hands-on experiments, mini-projects, and components built using the powerful utility-first CSS framework — **Tailwind CSS**.

---

## 🧠 What is Tailwind CSS?

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a modern, utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to rapidly build custom designs directly in their markup. It provides low-level utility classes that let you build completely custom designs without ever leaving your HTML.

---

## 🚀 Key Concepts Practiced

- Tailwind CDN and CLI-based setups
- Responsive design using breakpoints (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, etc.)
- Utility classes for spacing, colors, fonts, and layouts
- Customizing Tailwind via `tailwind.config.js`
- Dark mode support
- Flexbox and Grid layouts
- Reusable UI components

* A reference for common Tailwind patterns
